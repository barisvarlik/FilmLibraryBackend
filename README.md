# Film Library Backend

N-Layer backend application for a film library. CRUD operations with .NET, EF Core and MSSQL.

* Complex relationships involved as 1:N for Director:Film, N:N for Actor:Film etc. 
* Architecture is as generic as possible, even to the controller, for the cleanness of the code.
